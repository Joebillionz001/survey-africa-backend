# Security Fixes Applied to Survey Africa

## Critical Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. File Upload Security (KYC System)
- **Issue**: Unrestricted file uploads allowing malicious files
- **Fix**: 
  - Restricted file types to JPEG/PNG only
  - Added file size limits (2MB)
  - Implemented filename sanitization
  - Added path traversal protection
  - Enhanced MIME type validation

### 2. Authentication Middleware
- **Issue**: Weak token validation and missing security checks
- **Fix**:
  - Added algorithm specification (HS256)
  - Implemented token expiration (24h)
  - Enhanced token structure validation
  - Added proper error handling
  - Improved demo mode support

### 3. CSRF Protection
- **Issue**: Missing Cross-Site Request Forgery protection
- **Fix**:
  - Added csurf middleware
  - Enhanced CORS configuration
  - Implemented origin validation
  - Added request verification

### 4. XSS Prevention
- **Issue**: Unvalidated user inputs allowing script injection
- **Fix**:
  - Created InputValidator utility class
  - Added HTML sanitization functions
  - Implemented recursive object sanitization
  - Enhanced form validation
  - Added client-side input filtering

### 5. Enhanced Security Headers
- **Issue**: Missing security headers
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Enhanced Helmet configuration
  - Added cross-origin policies
  - Improved CORS settings

### 6. Rate Limiting
- **Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks
- **Fix**:
  - Separate rate limits for auth endpoints (5/15min)
  - General API rate limiting (100/15min)
  - IP-based request tracking
  - Custom error messages

### 7. Input Validation
- **Issue**: No client-side validation
- **Fix**:
  - Created comprehensive validation utility
  - Added email format validation
  - Implemented password strength checking
  - Added file upload validation
  - Enhanced form sanitization

### 8. Package Updates
- **Issue**: Vulnerable dependencies
- **Fix**:
  - Updated express-rate-limit to v7.1.5
  - Updated helmet to v7.1.0
  - Updated mongoose to v8.0.3
  - Added csurf for CSRF protection
  - Updated other security-related packages

## Security Features Added üîí

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS
2. **File Upload Security**: Strict validation for KYC document uploads
3. **Authentication Security**: Enhanced JWT validation and token management
4. **CSRF Protection**: Protection against cross-site request forgery
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
6. **Content Security Policy**: Prevents unauthorized script execution
7. **CORS Security**: Proper origin validation and request filtering

## Files Modified üìù

### Backend Files:
- `/backend/routes/kyc.js` - Enhanced file upload security
- `/backend/middleware/auth.js` - Strengthened authentication
- `/backend/server.js` - Added security middleware and CSRF protection
- `/backend/package.json` - Updated vulnerable packages

### Frontend Files:
- `/js/api.js` - Added input sanitization to API calls
- `/js/validation.js` - New validation utility (created)
- `/login.html` - Enhanced with input validation

## Remaining Recommendations üìã

1. **Database Security**: Implement proper database connection security when MongoDB is connected
2. **Session Management**: Add secure session configuration
3. **Logging**: Implement security event logging
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated regularly
5. **Security Testing**: Regular penetration testing

## Usage Notes üìñ

- All forms now include automatic input sanitization
- File uploads are restricted to safe image formats only
- API calls include built-in XSS protection
- Authentication tokens expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting protects against abuse

Your Survey Africa application is now significantly more secure! üõ°Ô∏è
