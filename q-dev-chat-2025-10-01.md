## Key Insights
- **SECURITY PRIORITY**: User prioritizes fixing security vulnerabilities over feature development
- **REAL MONETIZATION**: User wants actual survey monetization through BitLabs and CPX Research APIs, not demo functionality
- **PRODUCTION READY**: User expects enterprise-level security with proper error handling, CSRF protection, and input validation
- **MINIMAL CODE APPROACH**: User consistently requests minimal code implementations without verbose solutions
- **AUTO-FIX PREFERENCE**: User prefers automated fixes for multiple issues rather than manual one-by-one corrections

have you fixed the siggnup page and if a usere tries to signup with the same email or user name it should show that it has already been thier making it imposible to signuo unless he usesanother one and i want once he or she has suucefully signup it should show the information of the person on his dashboard i thier anything else you would like to add and also upadate the entier pages fo this website

---

I'll check the current signup page implementation and fix the duplicate email/username validation, then update the dashboard to show user information after successful signup.

---

Now I need to check the User model to see if it has a username field, and update the backend to check for duplicate usernames as well.

---

I can see the current setup uses `name` instead of `username`. I'll update the signup page to add a username field, update the backend to check for duplicate usernames and emails, and enhance the dashboard to show user information properly.

---

Adding username field to User model with unique constraint

---

Adding username validation and checking for duplicate usernames and emails separately

---

Including username in user creation

---

Including username and avatar in registration response

---

Adding username and avatar to all auth responses

---

Adding username field to signup form

---

Adding username validation and fixing indentation in signup form handler

---

Adding user avatar and stats display to dashboard sidebar

---

Replacing static user data loading with dynamic user information display

---

Now I need to update the API client to handle the new username field and ensure proper error handling for duplicate checks.

---

The API client looks good and should handle the username field automatically. Now let me update the main app.js to properly handle the new user data structure.

---

Now I need to update the app.js to properly handle the new user structure with username and avatar.

---

Updating user management to handle new user structure with username and avatar

---

Now let me update the dashboard to properly initialize the app and handle the async loading:

---

Updating dashboard initialization to properly handle user authentication and data loading

---

Now let me create a simple script to update all the other pages to use the new user structure. First, let me check what other pages exist:

---

Let me update the login page to handle the new user structure as well:

---

Making login form async and adding forgot password link

---

Now let me create a simple update script to ensure all pages have consistent styling and navigation. Let me check a few key pages first:

---

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of all the changes I've made and test the signup flow. Let me also update the app.js init method to be async:

---

Making init method async and only loading user data if user exists

---

Now let me start the backend server to test the complete signup flow:

---

Starting the backend server to test the signup functionality

---

Let me check if Node.js is installed and start the server properly:

---

Checking Node.js installation and starting server with node directly

---

review the code and check for errors

---


I'll review the code and check for errors using the code review tool.

I will scan the diff for the following files/folders:
